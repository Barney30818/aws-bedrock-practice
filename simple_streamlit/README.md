# Introduction

Streamlit is an open-source Python framework for building front-end applications to demo machine learning applications. Streamlit provides a library of commands for displaying web elements. You can see the list of controls in the [Streamlit API reference](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference) .

Streamlit allows you to build simple and attractive user interfaces with a relatively small amount of Python code. For back-end developers, this means you can create demo applications for your code, without having to learn the various programming languages, frameworks, and hosting platforms for front-end development. Even for front-end developers, it allows you to quickly build a proof of concept to validate your approach.

Streamlit is well suited for creating generative AI prototypes. Throughout this workshop, you will have the opportunity to try a wide variety of Streamlit's capabilities that greatly simplify the demo-building process.

You run your streamlit applications from the command line using the streamlit run command. You can find a more in-depth introduction to Streamlit at its [Get started page](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started) .

# Run the streamlit app

Run the streamlit command from the terminal.
